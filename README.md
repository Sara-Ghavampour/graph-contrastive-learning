# Contrastive Learning for Graphs
Investigating Properties of Contrastive Learning in Deep Geometric Learning

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While deep learning methods have achieved tremendous advancements within the last decade, it only works with Euclidean data, which clearly does not support non-Euclidean data types such as graphs. Geometric deep learning tries to employ and generalize deep learning methods to graphs. However, labeling graphs due to their domain-specific and complex nature is not always straightforward, resulting in label scarcity for graphs that necessitates employing self-supervised methods such as contrastive learning in geometric deep learning. This project aims to investigate different properties and effects of contrastive learning in Graph Neural Networks.
